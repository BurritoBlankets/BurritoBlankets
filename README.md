# ¿Qué tal? Soy Pillo

I'm a cybersecurity major at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical who just hopped into this carrer field from Air Traffic Control.

## About Me

I'm from Hawaii (born and raised), but my love for aviation led me to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical in Arizona where I later found a passion for computers. So far I've only taken a Python and Intro to Cyber Class; right now I'm studing Descrete Mathamatics and C. I'm just getting started on this journey, so do pardon the blank space for now. ヾ(〃ﾟーﾟ〃)ノ

## Projects

For funzies, I'm finishing up a Typing Test project made with pygame try it out with. 
```sh
$ *Still working on it*
```
I am also in the process of building my own virtual cyber lab, so that I can expitiment with pen testing.
