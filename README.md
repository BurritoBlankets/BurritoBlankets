# About Me
I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast major at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical. 

## Projects
* Most recently I recreated [SHA-256 in CPP](https://github.com/BurritoBlankets/SHA256).

* Currently, I am [teaching myself assembly (MASM)](https://github.com/BurritoBlankets/Learning-Assembly) with the help of Randall Hyde's book.
