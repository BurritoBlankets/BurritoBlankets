# About Me
I'm a senior cybersecurity major at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical. Originally from Hawaii, my passion for aviation led me to Arizona, where I discovered a love for computers.

## Projects
* Most recently I recreated [SHA-256 in CPP](https://github.com/BurritoBlankets/SHA256).

* Currently, I am [teaching myself assembly (MASM)](https://github.com/BurritoBlankets/Learning-Assembly) with the help of Randall Hyde's book.
