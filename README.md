# ¿Qué tal? Soy Pillo
I'm a cybersecurity major at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical who just hopped into this career field from Air Traffic Control.


## About Me
I'm from Hawaii (born and raised), but my love for aviation led me to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical in Arizona, where I later found a passion for computers. So far, I've taken a Python, C, and Linux Operating Systems course. In the fall I will be taking Data Structures, Computer Networks and Cryptography. My summer schedule is pretty boring, so below are some projects I'm currently working on. o( ❛ᴗ❛ )o


## Projects
* For funsies, I'm in the process of making a [Solitare Game](https://github.com/BurritoBlankets/Solitare) in C, by utilizing the ncurses library 

* Being facinated with the idea of malware detection I'm also currently learing Assembly. Currently I'm referencing *The Art of Assembly Language* by  Randall Hyde.
