# ¿Qué tal? Soy Pillo
I'm a cybersecurity major at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical who just hopped into this career field from Air Traffic Control.


## About Me
I'm from Hawaii (born and raised), but my love for aviation led me to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical in Arizona, where I later found a passion for computers. So far, I've only taken Python and Intro to Cyber Class; I'm currently studying Discrete mathematics and C. I'm just starting this journey, so do pardon the blank space. ヾ(〃ﾟーﾟ〃)ノ


## Projects
* For funsies, I made a [Typing Test made with pygame.](https://github.com/BurritoBlankets/TypingTest)

* Right now I am in the process of building a virtual cyber lab to experiment with pen testing. (Documentation coming soon)
